# AI-Projects
A collection of projects I did while taking Dr. Ansaf Saleb's Artificial Intellgence course at Columbia University - Summer 2017. Major areas include:
  - Uninformed Search Algorithms: BFS, DFS, Uniform Cost Search, Iterative Deepening
  - Informed Search: Adversarial Search, Minimax, Expectimax, AlphaBeta Pruning
  - Machine Learning: Overview of simple machine learning algorithms with sklearn
  - Constraint Satisfaction: Backtracking, Node Consistency, Arc-Consistency
  - Reinforment Learning and NLP
